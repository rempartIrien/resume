			"title": "Engineer",
			"description": "I chose my job and I love my job. Even without speaking of software, I wanted to be an engineer to think and make things. Around 20, I wanted to build phones, so I had to choose a telecom engineering school. And... well, for naive and young people, software and electronics do not seem so far from telecom. Today, I can assure you, I am really happy to be a software engineer!"

		"javascript": {
			"title": "JavaScript",
			"description": "I guess that like many students I first learnt Java and only PHP for the web. I integrated JavaScript world by sheer luck one year after my graduation and what a shock! At the beginning I was totally lost: there were vanilla JS, Backbone.js, canvas API... Then, I saw all the ecosystem built around this language and all the web concepts, including CSS and HTML subtleties. I loved it."

		"ux": {
			"title": "Beyond",
			"description": "I am interested in Node.js and everything about JavaScript and web, the ecosystem is particularly rich currently. Besides, another topic keeps fascinating me: user experience because no UX means no user. Also, having good processes are important and they often rely on good CI/CD (I even have my own Gitea and Drone CI in Docker containers). Reading online articles and attending conferences help me go deeper into all these topics."

I could tell you why I have always listened to music, why I hate radios or why I listen to a lof of indie rock nowadays, but even with all of this I'm sure my words would not be strong enough. That's precisely why I love music: it's a powerful emotion vector. That's because music is art. And there are dozens and dozens of different emotions to feel, which makes music an endless field of possibilities!"

That's the same for other travels: beyond touristic attractions, there are different customs and it's very interesting to discover them and learn why they exist. And last but not least: there is food!",

Sometimes, such projects are very simple; however, this is important to keep thinking about how to make things right and not just to copy and paste without noticing what's inside. Also, it helps me improve myself and learn new things that I cannot experiment at work. At last, computer science is just wonderful and let people make unbelievable things with just a keyboard and imagination and that's the funny part!"
