      "question": "Why did I choose to make an online résumé?",
      "answer": "I wanted to show a glimpse of what I can do, I think a website is more relevant than a piece of paper to show my work. By the way, the code is on [Github](https://github.com/rempartIrien/resume)."

      "question": "What did I use to make this website?",

      "question": "Why have I been to Montreal?",
      "answer": "After I finished my first year at ENSISA, I thought that there might be something else, something more: I wanted to experiment something new. So, I looked for an alternative to ENSISA scholarship and found the CREPUQ program (now named BCI) which let me apply to École Polytechnique de Montréal. Montreal was a wonderful experience with new methods of working, new pace, new people."

    {
      "question": "Why do I want to do more UX and UI?",

    {
      "question": "What was my best work experience?",

For the first time in my life, I was in charge of all the frontend project: I started the project, I created its architecture (component-based), I chose tools, I set the build chain and I developed a graphical framework with AngularJS directives. It was the first time I could do more than code and I loved it."
